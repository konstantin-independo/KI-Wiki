# Web Accessibility

Welcome to our article on **Web Accessibility**. Below, you will find three versions of this article, each suited to a different level of understanding.

## üë∂ Easy Level (For Everyone)

### What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means making websites easy to use for **everyone**, including people with disabilities.

### Why Is It Important?

Some people cannot see, hear, or move well. They might use:

- **Screen readers** to read out loud what is on the screen
- **Keyboards** instead of a mouse
- **Big letters or colors** to see things better

We want to make websites that work for all people, no matter what they can or cannot do.

### Helpful Tips for Websites

- Use **clear text** and **big buttons**
- Make sure colors are easy to see
- Add **text to pictures** (called ‚Äúalt text‚Äù)
- Make everything work with a **keyboard**
- Let users **zoom** without breaking the page

### What Happens If We Don‚Äôt?

If a website is hard to use, some people won‚Äôt be able to read, shop, learn, or play online. That‚Äôs not fair. Let‚Äôs make websites better for everyone!

## üéì Medium Level (Matura / School Graduates)

### What Is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility is about designing and developing websites and applications so that people with **different abilities** can use them equally. This includes users who are:

- Blind or visually impaired
- Deaf or hard of hearing
- Physically disabled
- Cognitively or neurologically impaired

### Techniques to Avoid Digital Barriers

Some of the most common accessibility techniques are:

- **Semantic HTML**: Using proper tags like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, or `<header>` so that screen readers understand the page structure.
- **Alt Text**: Adding descriptions to images using the `alt` attribute so blind users know what the image shows.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Making sure all interactive elements like forms and menus can be used without a mouse.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensuring text is readable by checking the contrast between foreground and background.
- **ARIA Roles**: Using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to improve dynamic content access.

### Why Accessibility Matters

- It's a **legal requirement** in many countries (e.g., WCAG guidelines, EU Accessibility Act).
- It improves **usability for everyone**, including people on mobile phones or with temporary disabilities.
- It reflects **ethical responsibility** to provide equal access.

## üéìüìö Advanced Level (Academic)

### Introduction to Web Accessibility

Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of ensuring that all users, regardless of physical, sensory, cognitive, or technological limitations, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web. The cornerstone of accessibility is the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**, currently at version 2.2, developed by the W3C.

### Core Principles (POUR)

WCAG is structured around four core principles:

1. **Perceivable** ‚Äì Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (e.g., providing alt text for images).
2. **Operable** ‚Äì User interface components must be usable via multiple input methods (keyboard, voice, etc.).
3. **Understandable** ‚Äì Content must be readable and predictable in behavior.
4. **Robust** ‚Äì Content must be compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Technical Best Practices

- **Semantic HTML** ensures assistive technologies can interpret the DOM correctly.
- **WCAG 2.2 compliance** includes criteria such as focus visibility, consistent navigation, and error suggestions.
- **WAI-ARIA** fills semantic gaps, enabling screen readers to interpret complex UI components like modals or sliders.
- **Color contrast ratios** should meet the minimum 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text).
- **Progressive enhancement** allows functionality on a wide range of devices and browsers.

### Broader Context

- **Legal compliance**: Accessibility is mandated in many jurisdictions (e.g., ADA in the US, EN 301 549 in the EU).
- **Intersectionality**: Accessibility overlaps with usability, mobile-first design, and inclusive design.
- **Automated Testing Tools**: Tools such as axe-core, Lighthouse, and WAVE assist in verifying conformance, though manual testing remains essential.

## Summary

Web accessibility is about **removing digital barriers**. Whether you're a user, student, or researcher, everyone has a role in making the web more inclusive. Accessible design is **good design**‚Äîfor everyone.
